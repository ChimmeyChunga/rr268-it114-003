<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Feature: Coin toss command (random heads or tails)<br><div><br></div><div>Implementation:&nbsp; I was able to implement<br>this feature by going to the processCommand() method and adding an else if<br>to check if the user enters the command &quot;coinflip&quot;, if that command is<br>entered it a &quot;coinside&quot; variable is created and then&nbsp; an if statement checks<br>a simple math.random to get either a 1 or 0 If greater then<br>.5 then it is heads and else it would be tails. Finally takes<br>that &quot;coinside&quot; with a simple string statement and passes it through to the<br>serverthread send method that tells the user the command worked and what happened<br>and then through the broadcast() method to tell everyone what he got.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What feature did you pick? Briefly explain how you implemented it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Feature:&nbsp; Message shuffler<div><br></div><div>Implementation:&nbsp; Much like the first feature this feature was implemented inside<br>of the processCommand() method as an else if statement to check if that<br>message starts with the command &quot;shuffle&quot;. If that command is inputted the code<br>then takes out the shuffle part of the command with a replace function<br>then takes what is left into a new message variable. That new message<br>is then put into a character list holding all of its characters, after<br>that a StringBuilder object is made. Then a while loop is made in<br>which a random number variable is made by math.random and in range of<br>the size for the character list, then that random number is used to<br>go a certain index inside of the character list which is appended into<br>the stringbuilder object and also removed from the character list so no repeats<br>of a character is made when creating a new string. This is all<br>done to shuffle the message and eventual make a new string that is<br>passed through the send() method inside of the ServerThread class that tells the<br>user to their shuffled message then it is sent to the broadcast() method<br>to tell the server the shuffled message.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>So my biggest issue was figuring out how to shuffle the message within<br>the processCommands() method it took a bit of research and digging around to<br>find a good solution but I eventually found out about stringbuilder object which<br>helps a lot to take the characters in the list that get randomized<br>and add them on to this object then convert back easily to a<br>string. This made things much more easier for me because I was worried<br>I would have to create another method outside of the processCommands() method but<br>found an alternate more simple solution.<br></p><br></td></tr>
